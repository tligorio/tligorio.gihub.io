## DEEP LEARNING



This course employs a hands-on approach to establish foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms, merging theoretical concepts with hands-on application. Participants will acquire hands-on experience in building neural networks, as well as a deep theoretical foundation that is firmly based on mathematical principles. No prior experience in machine learning is necessary. The initial weeks are dedicated to establishing a solid foundation in machine learning fundamentals, followed by an in-depth exploration of deep learning algorithms. A background in calculus, linear algebra, and Python programming is essential for this course.

**Team-taught with Professor Susan L. Epstein**



**Required text**
*Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow*, A. GÃ©ron, **3rd edition.** ISBN 13: 9781098125974.
