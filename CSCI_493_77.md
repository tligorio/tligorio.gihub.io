## DEEP LEARNING

This course employs a hands-on approach to establish foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms, merging theoretical concepts with hands-on application. Participants will acquire hands-on experience in building neural networks, as well as a deep theoretical foundation that is firmly based on mathematical principles. No prior experience in machine learning is necessary. The initial weeks are dedicated to establishing a solid foundation in machine learning fundamentals, followed by an in-depth exploration of deep learning algorithms. A background in calculus, linear algebra, and Python programming is essential for this course.
